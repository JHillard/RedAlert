Welcome to RedAlert's documentation!
====================================
If you want to post to reddit and walk away, this is the app for you. Perfect for content creators.

RedAlert monitors reddit and notifies you via text message when something happening. It will directly text you your PMs (across multiple alt accounts), let you know how your important post is doing, and notify you if anyone mentions keywords you can input.
