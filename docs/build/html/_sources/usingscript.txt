Using the Script
================	

RedAlert will monitor all the things on Reddit that you want to know about. Once you go through the :ref:`first-time` and decide what you want to monitor, you'll never have to worry about it again. Just start it up, authenticate, and be on your merry way!

This script is designed to be run in terminal on a Linux environment with Python3. Intimidated by the terminal? Don't be! I'll walk you through everything.

Quick Start

Follow :ref:`first-time` and go through the steps of :ref:`red-auth`.

RedAlert by default starts by checking your messages. So if that's all you need, you can just run it from there!
