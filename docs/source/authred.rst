.. _red-auth:

Authenticating Reddit
=======================

Give RedAlert Access
---------------------

Now it's time to let RedAlert see your messages!
To do that, go to the link presented by RedAlert on startup. Login into Reddit and then allow the app. Your browser will then redirect to a dead webpage. Copy the access token there and paste it into the script.

It'll be different every time. Each time you start up RedAlert you'll need to do this.

And there you go, you are ready to start recieving messages!



.. _account-add:

Adding More Reddit Accounts
------------------------------
You may have more than one reddit account you'd like to recieve messages from.
Just choose the option::

 	 3.Add User

And you'll repeat the steps in :ref:`red-auth`
Once that is done you'll be able to choose which user gets checked. Hooray! Alt mail checked!
