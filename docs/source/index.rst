   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to RedAlert's documentation!
====================================
If you're a content creator or need to know if certain things are being discussed, this is the app for you.

RedAlert monitors reddit and notifies you via text message when something happening. It will directly text you your PMs (across multiple alt accounts), let you know how your important post is doing, and notify you if anyone mentions keywords you can input.
