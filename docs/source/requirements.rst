Required Software/Libraries
===========================

To run RedAlert you need a few things installed (of course!).

First, you'll need Python (RedAlert 1.01 was written with python3.3 if you're from the future)

Then you'll need some libraries. Here's all the libraries used in RedAlert:

* `The Standard Library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>`_
* `Praw <https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_
* `Requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_

TLDR; run:
::

	pip install praw
	pip install requests

You'll also need:

*  A Gmail account
*  A phone number

This app sends you text messages.  If you have to pay for text messages, you'll be charged by the carrier.
